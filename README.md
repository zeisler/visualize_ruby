# VisualizeRuby

![logo](logo.jpg)

Write a Ruby code and see method interactions on a flow chart. Works with procedural code, bare methods, and Classes.
This is experimental project and does not support all types of code. 
If you'd like it to support more types of code please pull request.

[Demo](https://visualize.dustinzeisler.com)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'visualize_ruby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install visualize_ruby
    
### Install GraphViz

 MacOS

    $ brew install graphviz
    
 Linux
    
    $ sudo apt-get install graphviz

## Usage

### Create a graph by statically parsing the code. 

```ruby
require "visualize_ruby"

ruby_code = <<~RUBY
  if hungry?
    eat
  else
    work
  end
RUBY

results = VisualizeRuby::Builder.new(ruby_code: ruby_code).build
VisualizeRuby::Graphviz.new(results).to_graph(path: "example.png")
```

### Add an execution path to graph
```ruby
require "visualize_ruby"

ruby_code = <<~RUBY
  class Worker
    def initialize(hungry:)
      @hungry = hungry
    end

    def next_action
      if hungry?
        :eat
      else
        :work
      end
    end

    def hungry?
      @hungry
    end
  end
RUBY

calling_code = <<~RUBY
  Worker.new(hungry: true).next_action
RUBY

VisualizeRuby.new do |vb|
  vb.ruby_code = ruby_code # String, File, Pathname
  vb.trace(calling_code)  # String, File, Pathname, Proc - optional
  vb.output_path = "runner_trace.png" # file name with media extension.
end
```

### Visualize Loops
Adds a count if the node is called more than once.

```ruby
require "visualize_ruby"

ruby_code = <<~RUBY
  class Looping
    def call
      (0..5).each do
        paint_town!
      end
    end

    def paint_town!
      "hello"
    end
  end
RUBY

VisualizeRuby.new do |vb|
  vb.ruby_code = ruby_code # String, File, Pathname
  vb.trace do
    Looping.new.call
  end
  vb.output_path = "loop.png" # file name with media extension.
  # in_line_local_method_calls = true # default, in line method body when calling methods on self. Looks better when tracing execution.
  # only_graphs = ["call"] # When a graph has many sub-graphs only include listed.
  # unique_nodes = true # default, Duplicate nodes with the same description are merged to point single node.
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
